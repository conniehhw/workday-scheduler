## Description

A single webpage designed to store your daily work schedule meetings, training and tasks. This simple calendar application enables a user to quickly see their schedule from 9am to 5pm (standard business hours) and add or change new events for the day and save the information. A feature that is handy is that it will save each change a user makes, when they open the calendar again or refresh the page, the edits they made persists.

## Installation

## Preview & Usage

* Red indicates the block of time has past
* Gray indicates the block of time is now (current)
* Green indicates the block of time is to come.
3. After inputting the event in the time slot of your choice; you click the blue save button, which will save your input to local Storage.
4. Upon refreshing / reloading the page, it will retrieve your inputs from location Storage and the event will still be available for viewing.
